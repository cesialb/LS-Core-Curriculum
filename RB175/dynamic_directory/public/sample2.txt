One outcome of this definition is that something which is mundane and obvious to one person can be magic to another. Many of us understand this concept unconsciously; outside of storybooks, we more often say something "feels like" magic than we say it "is" magic. Magic is a feeling. Sometimes it's a pleasant feeling, when things go better than they should for reasons we don't understand. Sometimes it's an annoying feeling, when something works differently than expected and you really want to know why.

People often say Tailscale feels like magic. This is not a coincidence. I've never seen anyone say ChatGPT feels like magic. That makes me curious.
