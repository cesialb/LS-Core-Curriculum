Magic

I think magic gets a bad reputation for no good reason.

First of all, you might be thinking: magic doesn't actually exist. I assure you that it does. We just need to agree on a definition. For our purposes, let's define magic as: something you know is there, but you can't explain.

    Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
    â€” Arthur C. Clarke
