# Problem:
# Write classes/methods necessary to make code run and to print following output

# Rules:
# Order of output does not matter

# Mental Model:
# There is a Pet class
# Initialization method has two arguments - type of pet, and name
# There is an Owner class
# Initialization has one argument - name of owner
# @name variable is able to be read
# There is a Shelter class
# Initialization has no arguments
# There is an #adopt method, holds two args - Owner instance and Pet instance
